INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [G:/jizu_project/project_summary/project_summary.srcs/constrs_1/new/cpu.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/mips_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/mips_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
